### I'm Lucas Leal

- I like to nerd out and find new things.
- Former lead of the Programming team in the UTFalcon Aerodesign extension project (2022-2023)
- I code mostly in Python, but also know a bunch about C, Java and some web development languages like HTML/CSS/JS.
- Sometimes the fun of the journey lies within being lost and finding yourself.
